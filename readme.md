# Loan Analysis


**Problem Statement**

Suppose a consumer ﬁnance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers.
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s proﬁle. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision.

- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.

- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a ﬁnancial loss for the company 

The data given contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc




**This is basically a EDA based project.No ML algorithm is applied in here.**







### EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)

The project is divided into 4 major parts

1 . Data Understanding

2 . Data Cleaning

3 . Data Analysis


4. Recommendation





**Data Understanding** 

There is nothing especial in data understanding.Only importing the dataset and check out the columns





**Data Cleaning**

- Check the missing values
- Drop some columns





**Data Analysis**

The main work is done in this part.

- Univariate Analysis
- Segmented Univariate Analysis





**Recommendation**

- From the analysis of Data_analysis part some categories can identified which are defaulted and which are good for provide loan.
